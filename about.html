      <h2>Education & Career</h2>
      <p>I'm a current MFA DT student at Parsons, originally having studied Marketing and MIS at Boston University (BU). My career path is focused on b2c product design roles, with a long-term aspiration to maybe own a cafe someday or become a creative director.</p>

      <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I find joy in curating playlists, discovering new places with **Beli**, and exploring the world through movies. When I'm not coding, you can often find me trying out new restaurants or walking around the city.</p>

      <h2>Technology & Reflections</h2>
      <p>The internet practically raised me, shaping my interests in storytelling with data and drawing from personal experience in my work. However, this close relationship also reminds me that technology is leaving people behind, which fuels my passion for accessibility in design and coding.</p>
