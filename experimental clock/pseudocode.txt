Pseudocode: PKD Clock

Initialize variables:
age = 26
hydration = 0
gameOver = false (boolean to track if the game is over)
isHydrated = false (boolean to track if the player just drank water)
lastUpdateTime = 0 (to track time elapsed with millis())

Setup canvas:
Create canvas 400x400
Set text alignment to CENTER horizontally and vertically
Initialize lastUpdateTime = millis()

Main draw loop:
Clear background

Display instructions at the top
Split into multiple lines for wrapping
Each line centered horizontally

IF game is NOT over (gameOver == false)
Calculate elapsed time since lastUpdateTime using millis()
IF elapsed >= 1 second (1000 ms):
Increase age by 1
Update lastUpdateTime

IF age >= 57:
Set age = 57
Set gameOver = true
Decrease hydration slowly over time

Calculate kidney color using map(hydration, 0, 100, 100, 255)
Draw left kidney (rotated ellipse)
Draw right kidney (mirror of left)
Draw connecting tube between kidneys (pale yellow)

Display current age and years left until 57
Draw hydration progress bar

Display hydration status text:
IF isHydrated == true → show “Hydrated!”
ELSE → show “Drink water!”
ELSE (gameOver == true)
Display game-over text in multiple lines

Lines are centered horizontally and vertically
Controls (keyPressed)
IF SPACE is pressed:
Increase hydration (max 100)
Set isHydrated = true

IF R is pressed:
Reset age = 25
Reset hydration = 0
Reset gameOver = false
Reset isHydrated = false
Reset lastUpdateTime = millis()
