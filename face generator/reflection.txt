When starting this assignment, I had an idea of a hamster and it's cheeks expanding as if it were eating, but when starting to code it, I don't think I have the coding capabilities yet to do something that complex since it seemed like I needed to consider utilizing the bezier curve function, etc. While that may be a challenge for next time, my second idea was to recreate Finn the Human from Adventure Time's face when he's really happy. It seemed more within my skill level, and it was fun figuring out how to grow his face. I spent some time thinking how I could incorporate the mousepressed() function to my drawing since it mainly focused on his face maximizing and minimizing, but eventually, I figured I could have the user grow his eyes to represent his excitement as I would see a lot of anime facial expressions reference that. Overall, I wanted to challenge myself a bit further from the last assignment.
