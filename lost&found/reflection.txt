Object description received: Sculpture in Eyre Square

The language my partner used to describe the image: "Eyre Square is the central square/park in Galway city. The sculpture in Eyre Square is a dynamic, semi-abstract brown copper-y metal form that visually represents the sails of a traditional Galway Hooker boat. The boat is a classic sail boat with the triple sails overlapping. Crafted from a copper-hued material, its vertical, curving planes rise from a central stage. The surface has a weathered, textural quality. Its bold, geometric lines contrasts the park space around it"

My interpretation of the image: I imagined 3 tall brown triangles intersecting in the center of a park. 

The depiction of the image using code: As a beginner coder, I wanted to include notes while pseudocoding to focus on the task. 
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  // set background blue for sky
  background(135, 206, 235);

  //make rectangle green for grass
  noStroke();
  fill(34,139,34);
  rect(0,height/2,width);
  
  //draw 3 triangles that slightly overlap with each other amongst the grass
  fill(139, 69, 19);
  blendMode(MULTIPLY);
  
  //first triangle
  push();
  translate(190, 250);
  rotate(45);
  triangle(0, 0, -40, -100, 40, -100);
  pop();
  
  //second triangle
  push();
  translate(210, 250)
  rotate(-45);
  triangle(0, 0, -40, -100, 40, -100);
  pop();
  
  //third triangle 
  push();
  translate(200,250)
  rotate(44);
  triangle(0, 0, -40, -100, 40, -100);
  pop();

  blendmode(BLEND);
}

The differences in interpretation at all stages:
V1 - I debated if I skip on the background, and just blend colors together so it looks like professional work, it looks way more abstract, felt like I wasn't covering all the key points mentioned in the description my partner gave me.
V2 - I debated on how to make it look more realistic and to the description, decided on overlapping rather than them just together, and included that it be a bit opaque to showcase the different parts of the "sails" of the boat. It ends up adding more depth. I think the challenge was finding out how to rotate the triangles to make them intersect and stand vertically.
