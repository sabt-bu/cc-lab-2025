A description of your Data Portrait. What was the personal habit you were trying to track?
For my Final Project, I wanted to explore systems of care, but more specifically, how we care for ourselves versus how we care for others. To do this, I decided to track my own acts of care over several weeks and visualize them in a way that highlights both perspectives. Each action I recorded is represented as a line, with its length corresponding to the degree of impact it had either on me or on the other person. The numbers were just based off of my own discretion though. In essence, the portrait is a mirror: one side represents self-care, and the other represents care extended outward. This allowed me to see patterns and differences in the way I distribute attention, energy, and intention across relationships.

An instruction for the viewers on how to read your data portrait.
To interact with the data portrait, click on any line. The visualization will pause, highlighting the selected action on both sides and displaying a note with the day it occurred, the act itself, and the quantified impact. The length of each line represents how much the action served me or another person. This interactive feature encourages viewers to pause, reflect, and understand the nuances behind each act of care, rather than just observing abstract lines.

Describe your design process.
I was inspired by Giorgia Lupi’s Dear Data and how she turns everyday actions into simple, human-centered visuals. Her work really resonates with me because it shows that data doesn’t have to be boring or sterile. It can be clear and captivating. I wanted to do something similar, so I made radial diagrams to map out my acts of care, with two mirrored diagrams showing care for myself versus care for others. Since I've also been spending a bit more time learning to code because of my final project, I wanted to challenge myself a bit further. One of the trickiest parts was parsing the raw data. Each act of care was just a string with the day, the action, and percentages for how it served me or others. I had to split each string, pull out the numbers and notes, and store everything in an array of objects so I could actually draw the lines. Then came mapping those numbers to visuals. I had to figure out the angle for each line, scale the length based on impact, and keep the rotation dynamic so the diagrams felt alive. I also added interaction. I stored the start and end points of each line so that when someone clicks, the rotation pauses and a note pops up showing the details of that act. Balancing readability, aesthetics, and interactivity while keeping the code simple was challenging, but it taught me a lot about turning personal data into a visual story.

Your overall reflection on the assignment:
What did you learn about yourself through the process of self-tracking?
Through the process of self-tracking, I learned that care is not always transactional in the negative sense, but sometimes the “transaction” is simply the satisfaction of giving or receiving care. The act itself can feel meaningful regardless of whether it is reciprocated in equal measure. I realized that care often exists on a spectrum and that media or cultural narratives about selflessness can oversimplify its complexities. 

What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization? 
In terms of data visualization, one limitation was condensing rich, emotional experiences into a single line and a short note. While this allowed me to create a clean and readable portrait, some of the depth of emotion and nuance was inevitably lost. At the same time, I gained a new perspective: by abstracting my experiences into quantifiable forms, I was able to see patterns I might not have noticed otherwise, making visible the rhythms and priorities of my care practices.
